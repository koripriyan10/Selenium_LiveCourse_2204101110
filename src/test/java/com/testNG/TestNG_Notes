Testng: Parallel execution of test classes, class and suite

Parallelism or multithreading in software is defined as ability of software, operating system or program to execute
multiple parts or sub- components of another program simultaneously.

Test NG Allows the test to run in parallel or multi-threaded mode.
Based on test suite configuration, different threads are started simultaneously, and the test methods are executed in them.

Parallelism or multi-threaded execution can provide lot of advantages to the users.
----
1.Reduces execution time - All tests are executed in parallel, multiple tests get executed simultaneously,
hence reducing the overall time taken to execute the tests.

2.Allows Multi-threaded tests - Using this feature, we can write tests to verify certain multi-threaded code in the applications.
Helps QA to configure their tests to be executed easily in multiple browsers or operating systems simultaneously.
There are different ways in which parallelism can be configured in testNG.
