We can use TestNG to perform load testing by creating multiple threads. We can even re-execute a test the no. of times we want.
Two powerful attributes of @Test annotation of testNG.

1. InvocationCount - This Attribute specifies the exact no of times a test method will get called.
2. ThreadPoolSize - This attribute sets the total no. of threads that will run to call the test method..
